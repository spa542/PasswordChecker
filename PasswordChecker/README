6/19/20

Project Description:
This project is a simple program to check the security and validity
of your passwords/usernames/emails... etc. This program uses the PWNED
Password API as a resource for checking online public databases with 
hacked passwords and usernames to check if your information is vulnerable.

Dependencies:
 - python 3.5 or above
 - requests pip module

To install requests:
    "pip3 install requests"

How to run:
To run this program, you simply must run the python3 interpreter and the file
that is provided with as many arguments as you see fit. Each argument should 
be a username/password/etc that you want to check for vulnerabilities. The 
program will read off the amount of pings (databases found) that contain each
argument that you provided.

Sample execution:
 "python3 checkmypass.py arg1 arg2 arg3 ..."
